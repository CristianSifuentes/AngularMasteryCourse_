# 🚀 Angular Mastery Course  
### From TypeScript Foundations to Enterprise‑Grade Angular (v19+)

> **This repository contains a complete, end‑to‑end Angular learning path**, designed to transform developers from TypeScript beginners into **confident, production‑ready Angular engineers** capable of building real‑world, scalable, and maintainable applications.

This course focuses on **modern Angular** (Signals, rxResource, Control Flow, Zoneless‑ready patterns), **real architectural thinking**, and **hands‑on projects** that mirror professional frontend work.

## Course Overview

This course is intentionally **progressive**. Each section builds on the previous one, reinforcing concepts through repetition, real examples, and architectural decisions.

You will learn:

- TypeScript with **strict typing**
- Angular from **first principles**
- Signals‑first mental models
- RxJS in practical, production scenarios
- Component communication and state management
- Routing, lazy loading, and modular design
- Forms (classic and modern)
- Performance, caching, and deployment
- Authentication, authorization, and admin workflows

---

## Section 1 – Introduction

A high‑level introduction to the course philosophy, tools, and expectations.

- How to approach learning Angular step‑by‑step
- How Angular differs from other frameworks
- Mental models for long‑term success

---

## Section 2 – General Concepts: TypeScript & Angular

- Why TypeScript is critical for Angular
- Angular as a framework vs a library
- How Angular enforces architecture and consistency

---

## Section 3 – TypeScript Foundations (Recommended)

> This section is **not about mastering TypeScript**, but about becoming comfortable with strict typing and syntax.

### Topics Covered

- Basic types
- Objects, arrays, and interfaces
- Functions and arguments
- Array & object destructuring
- Imports and exports
- Classes and constructors
- Generics
- Decorators
- Optional chaining
- Type inference and strict mode

💡 *We also work indirectly with Vite to understand modern tooling.*
